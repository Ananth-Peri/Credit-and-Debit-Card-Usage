The objective is to assess HDFC Bank's standing within the industry in terms of credit and debit card usage.
To do so, I downloaded statistics from RBI and created a comprehensive dashboard using Excel, Python, and Tableau.
I cleaned and analyzed the data and added additional columns of key performance indicators (KPIs).
The analysis shows that HDFC is the market leader and outperforms the industry in terms of average spend per card.
The chart comparing average debit and credit spend per card for FY2022-23 reveals that the average spend per credit card is significantly higher than the average spend per debit card.
Woori Bank is an outlier with a higher average spend per debit card, likely due to recently issuing debit cards.
The project provides an overview of analytic work in the banking industry and improved my proficiency in Excel, Python, and Tableau, including skills like automating data pipelines and web crawling.
